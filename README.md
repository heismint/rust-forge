# ðŸ¦€ Rust Forge

Welcome to **Rust Forge** â€” my personal Rust learning journey and code repository.  
This space documents my progress as I work through *The Rust Programming Language* (commonly called *The Rust Book*) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

Rust Forge is where I:
- Build and document every project from each chapter of the Rust Book.
- Experiment with code examples to deeply understand ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- Track my learning and growth using Git branches and clean project structures.

Every chapter or project lives on its own branch before being merged into the `main` branch, ensuring each step is intentional and traceable.
