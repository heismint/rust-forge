# 🦀 Rust Forge

Welcome to **Rust Forge** — my personal Rust learning journey and code repository.  
This space documents my progress as I work through *The Rust Programming Language* (commonly called *The Rust Book*) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.

---

## 📘 Purpose

Rust Forge is where I:
- Build and document every project from each chapter of the Rust Book.
- Experiment with code examples to deeply understand ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- Track my learning and growth using Git branches and clean project structures.

Every chapter or project lives on its own branch before being merged into the `main` branch, ensuring each step is intentional and traceable.

## 🌿 Branch & Project Structure

| Chapter | Project / Topic | Branch | Status |
|----------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Hello, Cargo | `hello_cargo` | ✅ Completed |
| 2 | Guessing Game | `guessing_game` | ✅ Completed |

Each branch focuses on a single concept or exercise from *The Rust Book*, keeping progress organized and version-controlled.
